Rock Climber app technical specifications

It would be a simple app, which should satisfy the following requirements:
the user should be able to register and log in (log in screen + process + database)
the user should be able to log/save climbe routes with the geo tag of this route (latitude, longitude, route name, grading system to be used (fixed list), difficulty, length of the route, a climbing method (classic, sport, etc) and a comment field
from the saved routes we should make a database and at logging we should offer as autocomplete. For example if a route “Paula” with geotag really close to the current location was saved by the user already, with difficulty VI, and the user enters the letter P, the app should offer to autocomplete with Paula.
Later we should offer different statistics for the user, like overall height climbed, hardest climbed route, etc.
Again later based on geo tag and difficulty we should offer climbing routes to the user
add also a picture to the database?
